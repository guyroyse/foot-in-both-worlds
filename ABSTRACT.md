# The AI Engineer: A Foot in Two Worlds

Key points in abstract:

The Draw
  - developer who wants to do data science stuff
  - maybe touch on the fear aspect (I gotta learn this stuff or else I'll be obsoleted)

What Will Happen
  - talk about what an AI Engineer is and how you can be one
  - talk about what an AI Engineer isn't and how to not become a sad-faced data scientist

Outcome
  - know how, as a developer, you can fit into the exciting world of AI and machine learning
  - know the gaps you might need to close to do it
