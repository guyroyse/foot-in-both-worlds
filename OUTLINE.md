# The AI Engineer: A Foot in Two Worlds

Key points in talk:

A foot in both worlds:
  - QA Engineer
  - DevOps
  - Developer Evangelism
  - AI Engineer

Skills of a Developer:
  - solve problems
  - write and deploy code that doesn't suck
  - mostly, you put and take data to and from screens

Skills of a Data Scientist:

Happy & Sad Data Scientists
  - you want to know how to use the tools of machine learning, not be a data scientist

Opportunities:
  - so much need
  - number of data scientists
  - number of developers
  - look at that ratio... you'll be ok career wise
      - story about fears of offshoring

Steps to take to get started:
  - if you're junior
  - if you're senior

Warnings:
  - it's not just deep learning
  - math matters, but not as much as you think
