# The AI Engineer: A Foot in Two Worlds

Intro

IANADS
  - I am a developer on the path to AI Engineer
  - Here's my story.

I Wanna Be A Data Scientist
  - why: $$$ or FEAR or Both!

How to Be A Data Scientist
  - area of study (so far so good)
  - level of education (uhhh)
  - big list of hard and long things to do (OMG)
  - end result, you're a n00b

Something more accessible? The developer admixture
  - QA
  - IT Ops
  - Marketing
  - Data Science

You Have Skills that Data Scientist Don't
  - (or at least would take them a while to acquire)
  - you can: build apps, write clean code (with tests), manage deployed apps

Learn Some New Tools
  - you already know this because you do it all the time
  - many tools do the same thing

Developers are Focused on How
  - we know the what, figure out the how
    - learning Flask and Python
    - we understand HTTP, browsers, programing

For ML, How Isn't Good Enough
  - vague ideas, deep learning vs. AI vs. machine learning
  - need to learn concepts first
  - what does ML do?
    - Regression
    - Classification
    - Clustering
    - Forecasting
    - Anomaly Detection

Play
  - a pet project
  - an absurd application
  - a silly solution

Things I've Done
  - Python via the Evercraft Kata
  - Types of machine learning using D&D examples
  - Impact of X-Files on Bigfoot Sightings via Nexosis API
  - Bigfoot Classinator using DataRobot's NLP
  - Classified Viking Runes using CNNs and Keras

Explore
  - no guided plan, just exploring the space
  - more important to start than where to start
  - once you start, you'll find the next thing to do

Things On My List
  - Implement D&D examples using sklearn
  - D&D game predictor

Goal
  - learn python
  - understand types of machine learning
  - learn the Nexosis API
  - learn DataRobot
  - understand neural networks and CNNs
  - learn the use of more algorithms & sklearn
  - deploy ML into production

Warning
  - Dunning Kruger
  - Imposter Syndrome

Thanks!
